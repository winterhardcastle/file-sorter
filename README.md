# file-sorter
This python script sorts a folder by file extension. It is currently configured for my downloads folder, with all target directories being within the downloads folder itself. This can be changed.

# Usage
Windows + r and type "shell:startup". Drag the .pyw file into the directory that this command opens. By default this program will run every 10 minutes, and will automatically be started when windows boots. 

Changing the target directories and adding new extensions can be done in the extension_dict dictionary. Refresh rate can be changed by changing the refresh_rate variable.
